Second blog post: 

 - Explore ability of ChatGPT to query, summarize, and reason about tabular data
 - Example 1: Pizza menu (example from short courses)
 - Example 2: Langchain db query - simple retrieval, joins, etc.
 - Example 3: Filter db and then upload to chatgpt to comment on results, e.g., find relevant parts of text in e.g., reviews or book/play and have it summarize and separateley answer questions (such as relationship between characters)
